//! This crate provides the `SignRel` trait which maps relationships between
//! integers that only differ by signedness. For example, both `a` and `b` in
//! this example have the type `usize`:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use signrel::SignRel;
//!
//! let a: <isize as SignRel>::Unsigned = 17;
//! let b: <usize as SignRel>::Unsigned = 17;
//!
//! assert_eq!(17usize, a);
//! assert_eq!(17usize, b);
//! ```
